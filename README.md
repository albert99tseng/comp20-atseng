What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
 - The purpose of this Git repositorty is to showcase the work I've done in this class (comp20 Fall 2018)

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	- My favorite assignment would have to be mapping the MBTA using the google API and learning about the HTTP request. I enjoyed this assignment because it was a visual representation of how coding can be useful in the daily life. This made me feel like I can use code to impact others and made me feel like I was doing something correctly for the first time in coding. 


How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	- I have learned a lot in this class. Most people seem to not enjoy web deveolpment as much, but I find it very interesting and intertaining. I have learned a lot of different langauges in thsi class, even though I may not be very great at all of them, I can no understand code written in those languages. I will keep advancing my knowledge in these languages by practicing with them until I feel very confident in my coding ability.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	-  I learned how to debug using console.log() statement or my reading my code over and understanding the logics of my code, that had been really useful especailly when I didn't know where in my program was faulting. Because of this I learned how to solve amd debug things mofr efficiently. 


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	- I would love to have more experience building sites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I feel like I have a very a basic understanding of these langauges, but will most likely have a problem if I tried implementing it on my own.
