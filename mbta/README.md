MBTA 


1. Not implemented: The data window for the upcoming train schedules is implemented properly. The currect schedule will pop up after the second click on the MBTA icon instead of the first. The first click will show the revious stations schedule then the second click will show the current schedule. Sometimes timedata.data.length doesn't work properly but all you have to do is to refresh it. 

2. Asked some TA Michael and Ming for help 

3. Hours Spent: 15
