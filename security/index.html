		<h1> Assignment 4: Security and Privacy of Assignment 3 </h1>
		 Created by: Albert Tseng
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this assignemnt was to find privacy and security issues in assignment 3 created by Manish Aryal. <br>
			In assignment 3, we created a server that accepts game grids and final scores and adds them to a colelction in <br>
			the MongoDB database we created for the popular game 2048. The assignment nothing about security so for this <br>
			assignment, I given the task to examine security vulnerabilities in his web by performing multiple attacks. <br><br>
		</p>

		<h2> Methodology </h2>
		<p> Without looking at the code, I started testing the application and trying the identify vulnerabilities by using <br>
			query strings, command curl, and source code analysis. By using curl and query strings I was able to find some <br>
			vulnerabilities and security and privacy issues. <br><br>
		<p>

		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p> 1. <strong> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </strong>  - Attackers can replace data on the webpage </p>
		<p> 2. <strong> CORS Vulnerability </strong>  - Using an asterisk allow anyone else to mount a website in public</p>
		<p> 3. <strong> Inserting HTML Vulnerability </strong>  - Inserted data into the username when it's not suppose to <br><br></p>

		<h2>Issues Found </h2>
		<p> 1. <strong> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </strong><br><br>
			I used a script and inserted this script a gif into the username. The assignment wasn't expecting a gif of an animal <br>
			to over take the entire screen and was caught by surprise. Below is the script I used to insert the gif.
			<br><br>
			<img src= "xss_code.png" alt = "XSS Code" width= "700">
			<br><br>
			This is what is looks like when I reloaded the page with the script. As you can see, the gif took over the entire page of the web server.
			<br><br>
			<img src= "xss_gif.png" alt = "XSS Gif" width = "700">
			<br><br>
			The severity of this issue is HIGH because by entering a script in the username portion while curling, a hacker can overtake <br>
			an entire website. By doing this, the hacker replaces the data for a certain amount of time with the gif. The link and the XSS <br>
			vulnerability cause the script to load from an external website into the target web page. To solve this problem, it is essential <br>
			that Web applications to be developed using some form of security development lifecycle (SDL). SDL's aim is to reduce the <br>
			number of security-related design and coding errors in an application, and reduce the severity of any errors that remain undetected.<br>
		</p>

		<p> 2. <strong> CORS Vulnerability </strong><br><br>
			For this vulnerability, I went directly into the source code to find it. The "*" in res.header("Access-Contorol-Allow-Origin", "*") <br>
			allows users to curl data into the web server. With an asterisk configuration of the CORS server, it is possible for anyone else to <br>
			mount a website in public. Because of this it allows others to interoperate with a users data. Even if you authenticate against that <br>
			data, the “*” mounting of it, allows for third-parties to deploy first class applications interoperating with one's data. In Manish's code, <br>
			ALL Cross Origin Resource Sharing requests in the CORS Headers. 
			<br><br>
			<img src = "cors.png" alt = "CORS" width ="700">
			<br><br>
			The severity of this is LOW because the data entered in this web applciation is just the username, score and the grid. However if it were <br>
			to be a web application with something confidential such as a persons contact information, the severity this vulnerability would be very high. <br>
			To solve this problem, is by restricting the CORS by enabling it, to a single route, like shown below:
			<br><br>
			<img src = "cors_single.png" alt = "Cors Single" width = "700">
		</p>

		<p> 3. <strong> Inserting HTML Vulnerability </strong> <br><br>
			For this vulnerability, I instered a HTML code that linked to a potato gif and instered into the username of the data. I used the gif <br>"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2yYNt8DXoyKRdm/giphy.gif" to created the vulnerability.
			<br><br>
			<img src = "html_code.png" alt = "HTML CODE" width ="700">
			<br><br>
			When I inserted the gif into the username portion of the database, the gif instantly replaces the part where an actual username is suppose <br>
			to be. This is what happened:
			<br><br>
			<img src ="html_gif.png" alt = "HTML GIF" width ="600">
			<br><br>
			The severity of this issue is LOW for this case beasue the web application only takes in username, scores, and grid. Since a username <br>
			for the game 2048 is really important, it big harm isn't done. However, if was something confidential, doing this allows data to be completely <br>
			erased and replaced which can cause a huge problem. A solution to this problem would be to use a HTML Injection scanner. For example, the WAS <br>
			application can be used as it tests with the different inputs and not just stops with the first failed. Using the injection scanner can help <br>
			prevent an inserting HTML vulnerability.
			<br><br>
		</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p> This exercise illustrated that if you naively create a working app with no security considerations, it's incredibly easy to inject data, <br>
			destroy code, and steal sensitive information. This is very important because without knowing these possible vulnerabilities and how <br>
			to prevent it, your web application wouldn't be secure at all.
