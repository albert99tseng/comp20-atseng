		<h1> Assignment 4: Security and Privacy of Assignment 3 </h1>
		Albert Tseng
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> The purpose of this assignemnt was to find privacy and security issues in assignment 3 created by Manish Aryal. <br>
			In assignment 3, we created a server that accepts game grids and final scores and adds them to a colelction in <br>
			the MongoDB database we created for the popular game 2048. The assignment nothing about security so for this <br>
			assignment, I given the task to examine security vulnerabilities in his web by performing multiple attacks. <br><br>
		</p>

		<h2> Methodology </h2>
		<p> Without looking at the code, I started testing the application and trying the identify vulnerabilities by using <br>
			query strings, command curl, and source code analysis. By using curl and query strings I was able to find some <br>
			vulnerabilities and security and privacy issues. <br><br>
		<p>

		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p> 1. <strong> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </strong>  - Attackers can replace data on the webpage </p>
		<p> 2. <strong> CORS Vulnerability </strong>  - Using an asterisk allow anyone else to mount a website in public</p>
		<p> 3. <strong> Inserting HTML Vulnerability </strong>  - Inserted data into the username when it's not suppose to <br><br></p>

		<h2>Issues Found </h2>
		<p> 1. <strong> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) </strong><br><br>
			I used a script and inserted this script a gif into the username. The assignment wasn't expecting a gif of an animal <br>
			to over take the entire screen and was caught by surprise. Below is the script I used to insert the gif.
			<br><br>
			<img src= "xss_code.png" alt = "XSS Code" width= "1000">
			<br><br>
			This is what is looks like when I reloaded the page with the script. As you can see, the gif took over the entire page of the web server.
			<br><br>
			<img src= "xss_gif.png" alt = "XSS Gif" width = "700">
			<br><br>
			The severity of this issue is high because by entering a script in the username portion while curling, a hacker can overtake <br>
			an entire website. By doing this, the hacker replaces the data for a certain amount of time with the gif. The link and the XSS <br>
			vulnerability cause the script to load from an external website into the target web page. To solve this problem, it is essential <br>
			that Web applications to be developed using some form of security development lifecycle (SDL). SDL's aim is to reduce the <br>
			number of security-related design and coding errors in an application, and reduce the severity of any errors that remain undetected.<br>
